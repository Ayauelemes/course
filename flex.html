        <h1>Snowboarding</h1>
        <p>
            Snowboarding is a winter sport that involves descending a slope
            that is covered with snow while standing on a board attached to
            a rider's feet, using a special boot set onto a mounted binding.
            The development of snowboarding was inspired by skateboarding,
            sledding, surfing and skiing.

        <h3>Is snowboarding easier than skiing?</h3>
        <p>
            Snowboarding tends to be harder to learn than downhill skiing
            because both feet are attached to the same board. You won't be
            able to take a step like you normally would. Instead, you'll need
            to lean to the side to move the board.

        <p>
            Both skiing and snowboarding take honest effort to improve at any
            stage. Snowboarding is harder to start learning because braking
            in a straight line and the lift skills needed are harder. After
            that, they are the same difficulty to learn.

            <b>Snowboarding</b> is believed to have originated in the United States.
            Though its origins are sketchy, and plenty of children and adults
            can claim to have stood up on a flat surface of some sort and slid
            down their local sled hill, there are several names, dates, and
            inventions that are agreed-upon highlights in the most common
            histories of the sport.

        <h3>What country was snowboarding invented in?</h3>
        <p>Snowboarding was developed in the United States, inspired by skateboarding, sledding, surfing, and skiing. It became popular around the world and was introduced as a Winter Olympic Sport at Nagano in 1998 and featured in the Winter Paralympics at Sochi in 2014.</p>
        <h4>It feels like nothing is going in, as you take tumble after tumble. It's also exhausting, mostly because of having to pick yourself up every few minutes. Do not despair though, there is light at the end of the tunnel!</h4>
        <h5>For winter sports enthusiasts who prefer travelling in the snow on a board instead of skis, there is nothing better. For many of them, the snowboard is not just a piece of sports equipment. It is also a piece of freedom and a way of life</h5>

        <h2>Professional snowboarding</h2>
        <p>While the first snowboard companies fielded “teams” of riders to compete in the early 1980s, there was little to no prize money, and the companies themselves had no capital to compensate riders. But this changed as snowboarding increased in popularity and acceptance. The quickly growing sport developed a World Cup contest in 1985 and an international ruling body, the International Snowboarding Federation, in 1990.</p>
